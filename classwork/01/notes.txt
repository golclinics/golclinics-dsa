Disadvantages of reversing a list using slicing (eg A[::-1])
    - It does a shallow copy ie, modifying an element in the original list will 
    also be reflected in the copy
    - Not perfomant, works well for small arrays

Points to note:
- iterative is better than the recursive approach because:
    - python has a slow function calls hence some adds some additional overhead
    - python has a fixed recursion depth hence wont do well in big arrays - cython doesnt 
    optimize for tail recursion hence could cause stack overflow errors on recursion
